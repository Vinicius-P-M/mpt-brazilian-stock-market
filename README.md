# Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) - Brazilian Stock Market Analysis

This project implements the **Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT)**, developed by Harry Markowitz, to identify the optimal asset allocation within the Brazilian stock market (B3). It balances risk and return by simulating thousands of portfolio combinations to define the **Efficient Frontier**.

## 🚀 Strategic Overview
For a data professional with an economics background, this project demonstrates the ability to translate complex financial theories into robust, scalable code. It moves beyond simple data visualization to provide actionable investment insights through statistical modeling and optimization.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
*   **Language:** Python
*   **Data Analysis:** Pandas, NumPy
*   **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn
*   **Financial Data:** YFinance (Yahoo Finance API)

## 📊 Key Features
*   **Automated Data Ingestion:** Dynamic extraction of historical stock prices directly from the Yahoo Finance API.
*   **Statistical Modeling:** Calculation of logarithmic returns, annualized mean returns, and the covariance matrix for risk assessment.
*   **Monte Carlo Simulation:** Generation of 10,000+ random portfolio weight combinations to explore the risk-return spectrum.
*   **Sharpe Ratio Optimization:** Identification of the "Maximum Sharpe Ratio" portfolio (maximum excess return per unit of risk) and the "Minimum Volatility" portfolio.
*   **Efficient Frontier Visualization:** Clear graphical representation of the optimal portfolios against the backdrop of all simulated possibilities.

## 📈 Methodology
1.  **Selection:** Defined a diversified basket of assets from the B3.
2.  **Simulation:** Applied random weight assignments, ensuring the sum of weights equals 1.
3.  **Optimization:** Evaluated performance based on risk-free rate assumptions and historical volatility.
4.  **Results:** Visualized the capital allocation line and the frontier of optimal investment.
